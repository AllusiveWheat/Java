How to play this game. 

Well it isn't really a game but well.

Either use an IDE and use gradle to install the things you need to run.

Use the mouse to move around, and it will trace a ray to a cube and increase score.

Overall it's a simple game. But I tried really hard doing 3D graphics with OpenGL.
